Implementation Of SysWhispers Direct System Call Technique In D.


## Acknowledgement

Thanks to [SysWhispers2](https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers2) for alot of ideas for this, SysWhispers2's inline assembly has been used in this project.
[KlezVirus](https://github.com/klezVirus/) for the function prototypes JSON file and [SysWhispers3](https://github.com/klezVirus/SysWhispers3/) project.


## Future Of This
I will soon release a DLang module generator for indirect / direct system calls, Which will allow you to seamlessly call system calls directly in your D code, For now, Enjoy the little example demos, Which will call **NtAllocateVirtualMemory** to allocate memory in the current process.
